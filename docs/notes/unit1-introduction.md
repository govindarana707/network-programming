# Unit 1: Introduction to Network Programming

## 1. Network Programming
Network programming is the process of writing programs that communicate with
other programs over a network using protocols such as TCP/IP.

## 2. Scope of Network Programming
- Web applications
- Chat systems
- File transfer systems
- Distributed systems
- Cloud services

## 3. Client–Server Model

- Web browser (client) and web server
- Email client and mail server

- Peer-to-Peer (P2P)

## 5. Protocols
A protocol is a set of rules for communication.
Examples:
- HTTP
- FTP
- SMTP
- TCP/IP

## 6. Advantages
- Resource sharing
- Centralized management
- Scalability

## 7. Disadvantages
- Network failure dependency
- Security risks
